Given, triangle pattern to print on the screen using the sql script.

What did I learn:

* For loop in unavailable in sql scripts, and so need to use WHILE block to achieve similar functionality.
* replicate() is a function which helps in repeating the string using a parameter, number of repetitions.
* Declare required variables, use conditionals and decrement the required variables.

Script:
----------------------
declare @n int;
declare @i int;

SET @n = 20;
SET @i = @n;

while @i>0
    Begin
        print replicate('* ', @i)
        SET @i = @i - 1;
    End


Similarly, consider another pattern of triangle.

Script:
----------------------
declare @n int;
declare @i int;

SET @n = 20;
SET @i = 1;

WHILE @i<@n+1
    BEGIN
        print replicate('* ', @i)
        SET @i = @i + 1
    END
