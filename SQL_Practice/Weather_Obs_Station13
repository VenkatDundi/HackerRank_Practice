1. Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880  and less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.

Requirement: Sum of latitude values from the table station between given range of values.

As earlier, used CAST to convert the data type of value to decimal with scale of 4.


Query:
----------------------------

select CAST(sum(LAT_N) as Decimal(10,4)) from station where LAT_N > 38.7880 and LAT_N < 137.2345;



2. Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345


Here, we consider the LONG_W corresponding to the largest LAT_N as per given constarint. A subquery has been used to match the condition for largest LAT_N.

Query:
----------------------------

select CAST(LONG_W as decimal(10, 4)) from STATION where LAT_N = (select max(LAT_N) from station where LAT_N < 137.2345);
