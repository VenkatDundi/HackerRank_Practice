From Given, Hackers(hacker_id, name) and Submissions (submission_id, hacker_id, challenge_id, score)

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. 
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

Explanation:
------------
* To calculate the total score of each hacker - Firstly, Identify the maximum scores of hacker from all the challenges.
* Used partition by to get the maximum score from all possible challenges for a hacker. Extracted the distinct records from resultset
* Through CTE, these scores are aggregated to sum and grouped by hacker_id, and name upon performing INNER JOIN
* Filtered records with total score > 0 and ordered respectively

Query:
------
with cte as(
select distinct s.hacker_id, s.challenge_id, max(s.score) over(partition by s.hacker_id, s.challenge_id order by s.score desc) as 'mscore' from Submissions s)
select cte.hacker_id, h.name, sum(cte.mscore) as 'Total Score' from cte inner join hackers h 
on cte.hacker_id = h.hacker_id 
group by cte.hacker_id,h.name 
having sum(cte.mscore)>0 
order by sum(cte.mscore) desc, cte.hacker_id;
