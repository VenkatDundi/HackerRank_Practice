Given, Students(ID, Name), Friends(Id, Friend_Id), Packages(Id, Salary)

We need to identify the names of the students whose friends salaries are higher than them. Need to order the results based on the friends salary offer.


Explanation:
------------

1. Joining the tables students, friends helps in retrieving the student and corresponding friend details.
2. Joining Packages to these tables helps us in identifying the salary of the students (Joining based on student id)
3. If we compare the salary of student to their friends salary, we can identify names of students. Also, the result set can be ordered based on the friends salary.
4. Here, I have used the cross join and applied filters. Need to observe other possibilities.

Query:
------
with cte as(select id, salary from packages)
select s.name from students s, friends f, packages p where s.id = f.id and s.id=p.id and 
p.salary < (select salary from cte where cte.id=f.friend_id) 
order by (select salary from cte where cte.id=f.friend_id);
