From Given, 

The table station consists of required fields LAT_N and LONG_W.

Requirement: sum of latitude and longitudes rounded to scale of 2


I could see that the data type of these fields is different as the sum and round functions returned unusual values with extended floating decimals. 

I tried to identify the actual data type of each columnas below:



SELECT

    COLUMN_NAME,

    DATA_TYPE

FROM

    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS

WHERE

    TABLE_NAME = 'STATION';

I could see that the 2 fields are NUMERIC type fields. I have used CAST to convert the type to decimal type with a scale of 2. Moreover, converted those values to varchar and concatenated them.





Query:
----------------------------------

select CAST(CAST(sum(LAT_N) as Decimal(10, 2)) as varchar) + ' ' + CAST(CAST(sum(LONG_W) as Decimal(10, 2)) as varchar) from STATION;
