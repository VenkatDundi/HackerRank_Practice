Occupations(Name, Occupation)

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).

Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.


Sample Output

Ashely(P)
Christeen(P)
Jane(A)
Jenny(D)
Julia(A)
Ketty(P)
Maria(A)
Meera(S)
Priya(S)

There are a total of 2 doctors.
There are a total of 2 singers.
There are a total of 3 actors.

Description:

1. Used Substring to capture the first letter of the occupation
2. Used Concat to make the required string
3. Order by to specify the ascending order
4. Grouped by Occupation to retrive the count for each occupation.
5. CAST has been used to convert the type from int to varchar so that it can be concatenated with string.


Query:

select Concat(Name, "(", SUBSTRING(Occupation, 1, 1), ")") from OCCUPATIONS order by Name, SUBSTRING(Occupation, 1, 1);


select 'There are a total of '+CAST(count(*) as VARCHAR) as counter, LOWER(Occupation)+'s.' from OCCUPATIONS group by Occupation order by counter, Occupation;
